I'll do what I can from now on.

I planned on writing various things back in the day (in Feb 2014), three years ago.

I'll at least start now.

I'll make a concerted effort to be consistent with my goals.

In terms of reaching out, and for e.g. 3VC, just remember that even 
if you'd been in touch earlier, it wouldn't have any meaningful 
difference. You might have convinced a few people, but how much 
impact would that really have?

Don't feel regret or FOMO about it. It's in the past.

Move on. Look to how to make YOUR future better -- what you want it to be!

	"Protests galvanize groups and display strong opposition, but they�re not sufficient. Not only are they relatively ineffective at changing policy, they�re also falsely cathartic to those protesting. Protestors get all kinds of feel-good that they�re among fellow believers and standing up for what�s right, and they go home feeling like they�ve done their part."
