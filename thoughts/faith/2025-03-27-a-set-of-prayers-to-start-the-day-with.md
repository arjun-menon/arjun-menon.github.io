7 prayers to start the day with (_from my friend Emmanuel_).


<u>#1</u><br>
The [Lordâ€™s Prayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord%27s_Prayer):

>Our Father in heaven,<br>
hallowed be your name,<br>
your kingdom come,<br>
your will be done,<br>
on earth as it is in heaven.<br>
Give us today our daily bread.<br>
And forgive us our sins,<br>
as we also have forgiven those who sinned against us.<br>
And lead us not into temptation,<br>
but deliver us from the evil one.


<u>#2</u><br>
An old Catholic prayer known as the [Anima Christi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anima_Christi):

>Soul of Christ, sanctify me.<br>
Body of Christ, save me.<br>
Blood of Christ, inebriate me.<br>
Water from the side of Christ, wash me.<br>
Passion of Christ, strengthen me.<br>
O good Jesus, hear me.<br>
Within your wounds hide me.<br>
Permit me not to be separated from you.<br>
From the wicked foe, defend me.<br>
At the hour of my death, call me and bid me come to you;<br>
That with your saints I may praise you.<br>
For ever and ever. <br>
Amen.<br>
