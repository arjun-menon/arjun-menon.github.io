title: Proverbs 30:2 and the lack of understanding
---

<div style="text-align: end;">
"Surely I am only a brute, not a man; I do not have human understanding. I have not learned wisdom" (NIV) <br>
"I am too stupid to be human, and I lack common sense. I have not mastered human wisdom" (NLT)<br>
â€” Provers 30:2-3a.
</div>

I was reading Proverbs 30 two days ago, and this stood out to me.

There's so much I don't understand.

So much is beyond the control of human intelligence or understanding.

Even finding a good partner is only from God (Proverbs 19:14); there is so little control I can exert via human intelligence, wisdom, cunning, or understanding. Only prayer works in this matter.
