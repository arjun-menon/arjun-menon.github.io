I came across an old blog post called "_[Be careful what you wish for, be content with what you have](https://theprogrammingbutler.com/blog/archives/2006/09/30/be-careful-what-you-wish-for-be-content-with-what-you-have/)_" recently, and it stood out to me. It references [Numbers 11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2011;&version=NIV). Quoting the key observations here:

> Notice in verse 1 about complaining in the Lord’s hearing… Doesn’t he hear everything, which means to me, don’t EVER complain about what he has given you…

> Not everything you want is best for you (see verses 18-20). Doesn’t God know what is best, He created us after all. Watch what you wish for, because there is a chance He’ll give it to you, but it may not be what you need after all. Pray and ask God to show you His will, so when you wish for something, it may be what God desires for you.
