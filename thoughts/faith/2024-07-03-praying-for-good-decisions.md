The question of making good decisions is something that's weighed on my mind for a while.

In particular, here, by "a good decision", I don't just mean doing what's morally right or what makes sense in an obvious manner. (Like not stealing, and not driving on the wrong side of the road.) I mean making ***a good decision*** when there are two or more choices, and it isn't immediately clear which would be the best course of action.

In situation like these, the only way to make the right decision is to rely on God. Because, who else knows what's best for us? We ourselves are limited in our knowledge and discernment, and as finite beings, we can't map out or predict what sort of future impacts a choice could have.

But God knows what's best for us. Only God can see how a choice we make today could cause future events to involve.

With this in mind, how do I know what the best choice is, in a situation? I need to ask God. My desire is that God would tell me what choice(s) to make, when I'm unsure of what to do next.



Philippians 1:9-11: "And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight, so that you may be able to discern what is best and may be pure and blameless for the day of Christ, filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ—to the glory and praise of God."

Romans 12:2: "Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.
Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will."

This in relation to making good decisions, in accordance with God's will.
