In the morning, as soon as I’m awake, I focus on trusting in God, and I take peace from it.

There’s no sense in not going to God, when we have such a good, great, and amazing God.

Those feelings of sadness, regret, anxiety, etc. — these are feelings you get when you don’t have God, and have to do it all yourself.

The hopeless pain mode is a very different mode for your mind vs. the trust, peace, and happy in God mode.

If you make a habit of trusting regularly, then it becomes the way your brain works.

Just serve God / start serving God more — when you are serving God, those hopeless and anxious and regretful parts of the mind will get smaller and smaller.

It’s the habit of the unbelievers to worry & run after all sorts of things (things that they need — it’s not bad things), instead of trusting in the Father. Let’s trust in our God & our Father.

Good pslam to read: Pslam 62.

If you have faith, that God will give you the right person at the right time, then you’ll stop thinking about all this. And you’ll think about other things, and seek first the kingdom. Why worry, since God will deliver.

Do not make emotions your boss.

It’s good to not give into that feeling of wanting to feel comfort all the time.

Anything you do: Be in a mind of connection and trust in the Lord.

When you’re feeling sad about something, brining it to the Lord is better than thanking about it a lot.
