I heard today that not coveting might be the second-most important commandment. 
Even if it occurs at the end of the 10 commandments (e.g. Exodus 20:17), in the Hebrew tradition, the last item 
in a list is apparently the second most important thing. Quote:

> You must not covet your neighbor’s house. You must not covet your neighbor’s spouse, servant, ox or donkey, or anything else that belongs to your neighbor.

Many people's sins (e.g. including that of King David) likely started with a root of coveting.
I heard this from Peter Chu <sup>(at Love Like Christ 2025 Session 3)</sup>, an adjunct professor at the Tyndale seminary.
