Bad dreams. Nightmares.

The constant barrage of spiritual attacks.

Attacked spiritually on all sides. Singled out by satan's forces for abuse and torture. 

Pushed down mentally.

Media addiction that is mind dizzying, feels like mental chaos.

But sometimes the media addiction escape is used as a balm to escaoe drowning spiritual attacks / torment.

Why all this abuse?

I need the Lord's wall - God's invincible shield of protection around me.

Lord, protect and defend me from any attacks of the forces of spiritual darkness.
