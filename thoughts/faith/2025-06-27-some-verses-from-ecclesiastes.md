incomplete: true

Much dreaming and many words are meaningless. Therefore fear God.

It is better not to make a vow than to make one and not fulfill it.

-- https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-5.htm


Do not let your mouth lead you into sin. And do not protest to the temple messenger, “My vow was a mistake.” Why should God be angry at what you say and destroy the work of your hands?
