I heard today that not coveting might be the second-most important commandment. 
Even if it occurs at the end of the 10 commandments (e.g. Exodus 20:17), in the Hebrew tradition, the last item 
in a list is apparently the second most important thing.

Many people sins (e.g. including that of King David) started with a root of coveting.

I heard this from Peter Chu <sup>(at Love Like Christ 2025 Session 3)</sup>, an adjunct professor at the Tyndale seminary.
