AI and Programming

it’s like being a technical product manager (TPM)

it’s truly very empowering and awesome

what is it like in Heaven?

it feels like the intent of your mind reified.

I feel less mentally exhausted, less brain strain as well.

There’s more creative expression than anything, really.

It’s refreshing and awesome in a way.

Of course, I don’t want any AI for written English content (I always want a disclosure for written English content).

It was often so easy to distract myself with programming, with the tiny technical details. Now, with thinking of things at a higher level details, I can occupy my mind with concerns more relevant to the actual end user.

Am I more of just an English writer and thinker, with a heavy technical background, now?

I’m fairly confident seeing how much better even Claude 4 (that was released on May 22nd) is, that things are likely only going to get better.

AI will of course never be sentient like humans, but the improvement in productivity is awesome.

Of course, I’m not expecting any genuine creativity or genuine novelty from AI. That’s a uniquely human thing. 

Even with making video games, it's _personally_ a paradigm shift for me. Because, sometimes, the thing that excites me about making a video game is the technical challenges & programming aspects of it.

Overall, I feel like, this new LLM stuff is only more empowering & enabling.
