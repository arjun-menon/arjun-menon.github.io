Recent advances in AI in the past few years have felt rather shocking to me. If you had told me five years ago what LLMs today are capable of, I would have said that's impossible sci-fi that we'd need to wait a hundred years or more for, or that it might be entirely impossible to build such systems. I remember sci-fi stories with talking robots in them, and thinking to myself that the sort of AI needed for that sort of thing is nearly impossible to engineer.

Regardless, here we are today. Noam Shazeer, one of the authors of the paper _[Attention is All You Need](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_Is_All_You_Need)_ (which was foundational to current AI advances via transformer-based LLMs) when asked _"Why do large language models work?"_ [replied](https://archive.is/XE00r) that "My best guess is divine benevolence" and "It’s hard. Nobody really understands what’s going on. This is a very experimental science, which nobody’s really used to in the world of computing where everything is operating deterministically. But we just have no clue what’s going to happen. It’s more like alchemy or whatever chemistry was in the Middle Ages."

I can't really predict what these advances AI are going to lead to. It's a bit too hard of thing to speculate.




AI and Programming

it’s like being a technical product manager (TPM)

it’s truly very empowering and awesome

what is it like in Heaven?

it feels like the intent of your mind reified.

I feel less mentally exhausted, less brain strain as well.

There’s more creative expression than anything, really.

It’s refreshing and awesome in a way.

Of course, I don’t want any AI for written English content (I always want a disclosure for written English content).

It was often so easy to distract myself with programming, with the tiny technical details. Now, with thinking of things at a higher level details, I can occupy my mind with concerns more relevant to the actual end user.

Am I more of just a writer and thinker, with a heavy technical background, now?

I’m fairly confident seeing how much better even Claude 4 (that was released on May 22nd) is, that things are likely only going to get better.

AI will of course never be sentient like humans, but the improvement in productivity is awesome.

Of course, I’m not expecting any genuine creativity or genuine novelty from AI. That’s a uniquely human thing. 

Even with making video games, it's _personally_ a paradigm shift for me. Because, sometimes, the thing that excites me about making a video game is the technical challenges & programming aspects of it.

Overall, I feel like, this new LLM stuff is only more empowering & enabling.

To misuse a woodworking metaphor, I think we’re experiencing a shift from hand tools to power tools.

In fact this empowerment we get from AI adds joy

> “Writing computer software is one of the purest creative activities in the history of the human race. Programmers aren’t bound by practical limitations such as the laws of physics; we can create exciting virtual worlds with behaviors that could never exist in the real world. Programming doesn’t require great physical skill or coordination, like ballet or basketball. All programming requires is a creative mind and the ability to organize your thoughts. If you can visualize a system, you can probably implement it in a computer program.”
