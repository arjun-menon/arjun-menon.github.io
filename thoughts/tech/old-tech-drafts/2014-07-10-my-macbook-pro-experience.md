My MacBook Pro Experience


The Late 2008 MacBook Pro <and> the Late 2013 MacBook Pro

    how some of the specs are similar

        processor - 2.4 ghz
        hdd space - same: 250gb
        graphics - similar (discrete nvidia -> intel iris)

My Dell laptop experience

    Linux compatibility

    Kubuntu breaking on a regular basis (4 or 5 times in a single year)

OS UI: Kubuntu (Linux/Ubuntu with KDE) vs. OS X

    Keyboard shortcuts

    Front-facing tools:
        Ark
            Great archive viewer (built-in file vieweing), extractor, compressor.
            OS X offers nothing similar out of the box

        Okular
            Supports tons of different formats, including .djvu

        Kate
            integrated command-line browser, etc.
            Sublime is a nice alternative though


    Command-line
        I don't personally have to spend too much time configuring it.
        Jumping between words works properly (vs. Esc+B where you can't repeatedly hit B)
            On OS X you need to confiure it. And the defualt term isn't great, so iTerm2
        Command completion: apt-get, git, etc.
            On OS X, need to install other scripts to do this

Software
    The Mac does have some good software, but Linux isn't _that_ lacking.
        Dash.app is nice, but there are Linux alternatives (I haven't tried them)
        GitHub for Mac is okay, but I just use the command-line or git-cola on Linux
        Folx Go for downloading, but it sucks cmp. to KGet
        On Linux: Lots of good KDE software, that doesn't run as well on MacPorts


The Customizability
    I can't believe I'm saying this.
    I used to make fun of people for touting the "customizabilty" of Linux as of the reasons 
    to use it. I believed (and still do) that this particular aspect of Linux was one that 
    appealed only to developers, and so shouldn't be touted as one of the key advantages of 
    Linux. While it still holds true that most regular user don't care about tweaking their OS, 
    I've begun to see the value an open source OS (under a liberal license) provides. 

    While OS X runs smoothly without a hiccup most of the time, when it does crash or cause 
    problems there's no way *I* can fix it, let alone debug it. Linux, sort-of gives me a chance 
    to do this. As a KDE user, I more frequently have had to deal with desktop issues, but with 
    KDE, I at least am able to *try* to bugs!


Hardware
    the unacceptable wi-fi chip issues

    discussing this last, since it's not universal


In the Near Future
    I'm leaving Mac for Linux

    I'd go for a cheap machine that's known to work well with Linux
