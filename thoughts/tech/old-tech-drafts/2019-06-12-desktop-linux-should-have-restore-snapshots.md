title: Desktop Linux should have Restore Snapshots
---

I can't say how many times Linux has broken for me.

Even my Ubuntu running on DigitalOcean broke, and stopped booting. I enabled DigitalOcean backups after that. 


Linux distros should start creating a "System Restore Point" like Windows does, before any major package updates.

On that note: packages that are likely to break the system should be marked as "system" (or core") packages.
