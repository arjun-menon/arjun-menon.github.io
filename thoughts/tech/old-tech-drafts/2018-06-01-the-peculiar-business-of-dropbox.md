All Dropbox really offers is good syncing software, that works on 3 OSes, and good mobile apps.

The storage itslef is quite overpriced.
Most people don't use the 1 TB. (And now they're increasing it to 2 TB.)


Yet, people pay _hundreds of dollars_ for Dropbox over the years, *_just for the software_*.
