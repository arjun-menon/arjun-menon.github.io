title: Form of Money
---


Fund-based Money
----------------
A fund, similar to a mutual fund, that invests in and is backed by diverse assets.
Money where each unit is a share in this fund.


Value-Maintaining Dilution
--------------------------
Plausibly permanent increases in value of shares in this fund, in terms purchasing power, 
should be adjusted for with proportionate dilution of each share. Each shareholders' 
holding *must* be increased to reflect this dilution, and this dilution should not 
result in any decrease of the actual value of the shareholder's holdings.


Free Public Network-based transactions like cyrptocurrency
----------------------------------------------------------
Essentially free, extremely resilient, consistent transactions.
Network should be able to handle trillions of transactions per day.
Has a central authority, but transactions do not need to go through 
the central authority -- so not completely decentralized, but partially 
so. Resilient in cases of partial network (Internet) failure.
