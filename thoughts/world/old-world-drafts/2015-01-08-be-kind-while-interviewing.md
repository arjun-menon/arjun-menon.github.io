    I've done a LOT of interviewing, recruiting and ultimately a lot of saying "no" to people.

    Over the years I've landed on a series of personal rules on how to do just that.

    1. Always explain rationale around the No, to help them improve 2. Always let people down gently reinforcing positive notions as well, you never know what state of mind they are in. 3. Always respond to requests for more information

    This takes me a lot of time in my professional life, but it's making me a happier person. Ultimately, it's people's lives you're dealing with. You don't owe anyone anything, but life is about treating people well.
