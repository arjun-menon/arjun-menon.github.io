title: Raising the U.S. Minimum Wage without Job Loss
---

to avoid loosing 500k jobs -- quote article/piece that talks about this

set two min. wages -- the current and the future (for/during a transitionary period)

companies that cannot afford the new minimum wage can pay a wage lower than the 
    new minimum, but not lower than the old minimum
