e.g. the Indian Education System

    it tries to make computers out of people, with its:
        - massive focus on rot memorization
        - demand for perfection in mathematics
            - and math problems have more to do with computer-like rapid solving ability, 
            not creative or intuitive thinking. note: most real mathematicians would not 
            be able to solve such problems (1) quickly, or even (2) perfectly

in the near future, humans computers (and all humans who perform routine mundane tasks) will 
be replaced by actual computers. a human needs to differentiate himself from a computer by 
being capable of performing tasks that a robot or computer cannot.


we need to encourage creativity in education


Add extra credit to all tests so that perfectionism is not pushed upon students
 For example: in an out-of-100 test, for a test buffer of x%, you need 25 extra credits; 
              and a 125/125 score is marked down as 100.
