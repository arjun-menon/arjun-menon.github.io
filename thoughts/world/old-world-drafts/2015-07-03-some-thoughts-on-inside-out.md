while giving a good depiction of the human mind, I'm at the same time 
concerned that it oversimplifies emotions, and the human psyche

my biggest concern:

it might gives kids the idea that they are the mercy of their emotions
that their emotions control them, not them themselves

being a slave to their "feelings", and believing that emotions have 
a life of their might contribute to this slavery
