Why do people have guns?

some people claim it's for self-defense for robbers, home invaders, etc.
all i have to tell them is: really?

another argument is that it's to fight against the government if the 
government suddenly decides to take their rights away, like for example if 
a future President suddenly decided to become a dictator, abolished Congress 
and the SCOTUS, and reserved all power for himself (it's theoretically 
possible -- he is after all the commander in general of the armed forces, but 
i doubt the military would listen to him or comply to his wishes if he tried 
to do that).

But let's say, in a hypothetical scenario, that does happen. a nutjob has 
decided to do away with the age-old American democracy, and become a dictator, 
like Augusts Caesar, or something. The vast majority of the Americna people 
certainly wouldn't stand for that. They would certainly want their democracy 
back, and in the spirit of the American Revolution fought long ago, there'd be 
a movement to overthrow this dictactorial King George-esque government, and 
establish freedom and democracy again. And they would certain be right in 
wanting to do so, and trying to do so. But would they be capable of doing so? 
With modern technology, the truth is, they simply would be incapable of 
overthrowing such a government, provided the military remain obedient to this 
dictator. These people argue effectively that it is for this very reason that 
they keep and accumulate guns in their house. (A total waste of money, imo.) 
Seriously, even if you equipped 50% the population with machine guns, they 
still wouldn't stand a chance against a military that in terms of number of 
personnel is barely 1% of the population.

So what would work in such a scenario? I have a couple of theories. 
One thing that might be able to sway the government (ever so slightly), in 
such a situtation would be mass, large-scale, civil disobedience, like Gandhi. 
Even that doesn't work in most cases. A truly despotic government wouldn't shy 
away from killing a few of these people with impunity, "making an example" out 
of them, and using their deaths to terrorize the rest of the population from 
continuing in their civil disobedience. TBH, civil disobedience only works 
with government whose leaders have an iota of good moral values. Civil 
disobedience is the meekest of protests. It's meeker than standing in the 
middle of the street, and causing traffic congestions. It's hard for even  
slightly moral government leader to jail or kill people en-masse for that.

My main point here is that, the argument that guns are a protection against 
tyranny of possible future ever-so-unlikely despotic government is moot. It 
simply isn't an effective defense against it, at least in the 21st centry.

I suppose there could be people who like to collect guns for fun, like some 
people like to collect coins. 
Just like with the people who like to collect coins, this mindset does not 
make any sense to me, and I don't know what to say about it. Collecting 
random little objects that serve no purpose and don't enhance my life in any 
way, makes no sense. I suppose, that's that.



in terms of the government regulating guns:
- you can do a partial ban (make it harder for people to get guns), and it'll 
  most likely reduce the number of *second-degree* shootings, where a person 
  impulsively and without prior planning, does it. These people don't have the 
  will to jump through the hoops to get the firearms they want, or by the time 
  they start "jumping through the hoops", they realize what a crazy thing they're 
  about to do, and stop.
- a total ban would likely drastically reduce the number of the pre-medidated, 
  thoroughly planned out *first-degree* shootings. The really crazy insanse 
  people who are willing to go to lengths to cause mass deaths would be 
  incapable of doing so, at least at a large scale in a short amount of time, 
  without high-death-causing weapons like firearms. Most likely, the most 
  radid-kills-capable weapon they could get would be some kind of sword, and 
  even with that they'd have to train for years before they could use it to 
  do something do large numbers of unarmed people

essentially with a democratic trustworthy government, it's best if only 
the police and other uniformed personnel are allowed carry firearms, or 
really any weapon that is more effective that a sword or crossbow.
