abolishing arbitration clauses

requiring ratification or approval of all contracts 
drawn up by people, in order to have full force

.. not to repudaite all informal/verbal/signed/etc, and 
non-ratified contracts...

limiting redundant or duplicate contracts by implementing 
derivative (or differential) law, on contracts

how this further helps because established contracts 
have been interpreted, understood, and commented up on 
thoroughly already -- give an example of licenes, like 
the GPL vs others (such as CC-BY-SA)

requiring a certain form of registraion, or record of contracts
    video recording contracts


Requiring Simple, Clear, Emphatic Language in Contracts
    The Contracts Authoruity


Standard Contracts & Special Contracts

    Standard ones are the ones routinely issued...
        such as end-user license agreements
        business-customer agreements
