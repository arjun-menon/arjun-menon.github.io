Sticks and Stones

words can be venomous and toxic

it's not true that you can ignore words as the rhyme 'sticks and stones' claims

    you can indeed ignore other people to some extent, but 
    it always does begin to hurt after a certain point

    people need to be taught this, and taught to stop believing 
    in the false notion that words are harmless


people, and esp. children need to be educated to be kind to each other
