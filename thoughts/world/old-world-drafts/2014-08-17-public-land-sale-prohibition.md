title: A Way to Increase Government Revenue and Decrease Rents

renting public land out for private use

public land sale prohibition -- it should be effective retroactively from the date it was announced
        this will prevent rush pre-Act-passage land purchases

slow reacquisition of private land -- withthe principle of non-taking: do not take away something that someone has paid for

create "assured housing" instruments for certain cities/metropolis


the potential worst case = status quo today

private owners try to maximze profit; the worst a government can do is theÂ same
    on the otherhand govs have the *ability* to act philanthropically, 
    in the interest of the people
