**Blog Post Stubs**

Blog Post: dear God, erase all of this probabilistic based thinking from our brains — because we can have hope in YOU.

Blog Post on this: Information Flow Control!. ⭐️

_Be ALWAYS praying. Read a lot of Bible daily (critical)._ **Prayer + Fasting + Repentance**.

**_Having Rest in God (—Emmanuel): please blog about this_**: 🌟 

- Proverbs 3, and sleep well at night.
- **Psalm 127** is very short & very good. (About not having anxiety in anything.)

  

Actively pray to God and ask him specifically on what to do about the negative comments I make online about conservatives (and my negative feelings about them).

  

Stop thinking that things need to be done RIGHT TONIGHT — I don’t think that’s from God.

  

What **I’ve noticed about writing**: often times, there’s an essay I wanted to write, and a picture I had of the essay in my head (like the scotus medium post OR the env/carbon post), but even though I had tortured feelings about those posts or essays, a lot of the stuff that I wanted to write there or not necessarily accurate or valuable to the reader— and they could’ve been worded a lot better, and more importantly a lot more succinctly. A lot of those points could’ve been shortened and refined, and really, really really shortened, towards making a very sharp and succinct point.

  

“The man he wanted to be died of neglect.”

Writing these things **_is important_**. God wants you to use your time & your talents well.

(**Disciple** **_your_** **_attention_**. — Jon Tyson.)

Try **_even using Apple narration_** to write.

- **_Prayer_** (+ Bible) as the first thing in the day.
- Go on prayer **_walks_** in a park.
- Work (use laptop) **_outside_** your place. Two people said this (Luke & …).
- **He is with you** always, and he is pleased with you (Cedin).
- **_Exercise_** is critical for (+mental) health.
- **_Therapy_**: Dr K + Irene Lyon

And:

Submit to the meat grinder of the Holy Spirit.

Make sure Christ’s stamp is on everything you say. Practice makes you better at things.

Also: 

Words matter so much. James. And the firing freedom book’s Chapter 8

  

Blog Post: **Limiting Information Consumption** / Flow. Especially online information consumption.

  

Psalm 127 for work. Taking things slowly. Praying before doing everything.

  

Blog Post: **Being Purposeful and Intentional about everything**. Psalm 127. Doing everything with care and love.

BC should be renamed. Perhaps to ‘Pacific Canada’. Entities like ICBC and BC Hydro just have to make a one letter. The flag ought to be changed to remove the British Union Jack 🇬🇧; replacing it with mountains 🏔️ including lakes in the middle, the rising sun ☀️ above it, and Pacific Ocean water 🌊 below, and with a Canadian flag 🇨🇦 on a flagpole in the middle of the mountains. A change in the oath, with no royalty, but with loyalty to the people of PC and of Canada as a whole, respect for the first nations before us, respect for the values of DEI, respect for the environment, respect for honest and integrity, etc. Ban the use of the Union Jack at all arms of the provincial govt, and all lower levels of govt within the province.

DRCV post: One idea I had briefly shared with you when we spoke in early June was a form of _delegated_ ranked choice voting, where if no candidate wins a majority of votes in a riding, one candidate can transfer the votes they received to another candidate. A bill based on this idea would not change the voting experience, since you'd still vote for a single candidate, and perhaps might be more palatable to Parliament.

Prayer is the vine that connects me to God.

Listening prayer is listening for God’s spirit to speak. (At least that’s how I experience it; to some people God speaks through dreams.) A lot of the failures in my life can be connected to a lack of listening prayer.

Canada Provincial Immigration Act

- Provinces can issue:

	- Provincial permanent residence
	
		- It is not federal from residence.
		- It has to be permanent and lifelong.
		- Provinces may deny benefits if the annualized average taxes paid over an aggregate period of the previous five years is below that of the median worker for the province, and if an individual’s current ongoing income is below the provincial median.
		- Denial of benefits must comply with these federal statutory limitations; this matter is subject to judicial review.

- Provincial temporary residence

	- It can be an open work perimeter closed work permit, but the closed work permit cannot restrict a worker to a single company it can only restrict them to single industry and adjacent industries.

- The province has to build sufficient housing in order to issue either of these provincial residence or provincial temporary residence visas, except for construction workers and medical workers. The requirements include:

	- Calculate the total population growth for the province and the previous quarter. This includes people leaving after their temporary residence has expired, or permanent residence and Canadians citizens just leaving. It includes all population growth via federal immigration programs as well as the provincial nominee program. It also includes population growth or shrinkage due to interprovincial migration.
	- Calculate the total number of people that can be housed by the new housing units that completed construction and ready to be moved into, in the previous quarter.
	- Subtract the former number from the latter = this is the maximum number of visas that can be issued.

- Sufficient housing means that in the previous quarter, the number of units built exceeded the population growth as estimated by reliable sources for that quarter.
- [Maybe?:] Overpressure Correction: sufficient units to correct for the shortfall in the previous 5 years must be built, before the “sufficient housing” condition is met.

	- The federal immigration minister may waive or relax the overpressure condition.
	- Relaxation here means using a shorter look-back period than 5 years. But such a shorter look-back period must not be less than 6 months.
	- An overpressure standard relaxation cannot be retracted for 3 months.

- Provinces can process applications and approve applicants prior to housing availability, and non-citizens are allowed to put a deposit on a pre-construction home, if such housing is close to completion, and if the province communicates a honest timeline to the non-citizen applicant.
- Limitation on the right of the federal government to refuse provincial approval for a temporary or permanent residence visa, based on discretionary factors including the risk of an overstay or other prospective probabilistic future behavior factors. The federal government can only deny such visa approvals on security and criminal grounds.
- Further prohibition on the government delaying, impeding, or otherwise not fulfilling their duties to issue visas for people who have been approved by a provincial government. Federal courts are empowered to issue writs of mandamus to enforce this section.

- Federal adjustment to permanent residence programs:

	- Long-term residence: people who have spent a lot of time in Canada, with a cascading threshold based on visa status, and provisions for a regularization program.
	- High income earners: Individuals who earn over a certain threshold, demonstrable by over a year of bona fide earnings in that profession.
	- Provincial permanent residents, who meet certain qualifications, or after a certain amount of time (partially covered by the long-term residence programs). This would include an option for provincial permanent residents to directly apply for citizenship.

- Federal prohibition on any province using national origin, citizenship, race, ethnicity, place of birth, or skin color as a ground for discrimination in any provincial immigration program.

	- That includes any sort of quota that attempts to do limit immigration of any group of people based on these categories on which discrimination is prohibited.
	- This also includes a prohibition using their provincial immigration system to sponsor refugees from select countries, as this would violate this law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of nationality or citizenship.
	- Prohibition on a treaties or programs that gives an unfair advantage based on citizenship, unless an exemption is specifically approved by Parliament. Exemptions for already existing treaties and programs, including CUSMA, IEC, etc.

- AVR, to avoid loss of status. Work permit expiration is a distinct matter.
- Only civil fines and penalties for work without authorization, and primarily on employer.
- Enforcement system for provincial visas, with a **_gentle_** system to deal with violations.
- Authorization for provinces to create Primary and Secondary health insurance risk pools, notwithstanding other provisions of the Healthcare Act; and billing members of the secondary risk pool monthly for costs incurred. Also: to track the monthly effective cost of the Primary risk pool, and allow some individuals to pay to participate in either the Primary or the Secondary pool.

	- “In London, Bowman said, the most common options are subsidized flats for the low-income and luxury units for the rich, creating a dearth of middle-class housing. As a result, the city is bifurcated between the über-wealthy and the subsidized poor. “I think housing policy is a major driver of a lot of anti-foreigner, white-supremacist, anti-Black, anti-Muslim attitudes among young people who are frustrated that so-called these people get free houses while they have to live in a bedsit or move somewhere an hour outside the city and commute in,” Bowman said.”

How to avoid discouraging (and unproductive) political conversations:

- Share your thoughts in larger public forums (not necessarily just on 1-1 conversations with people):—

	- Write essays
	- Give speeches on YouTube and elsewhere

- Make/be friends with folks who are like-minded politically, so it doesn’t turn into contentious and painful relationships.

	- Or at least avoid any friendships with people who are very partisan.
	- Polarize rapidly: mention opposition to conservatives or support for the NDP early on, and see if they want to continue talking to you.

- Have good times and good conversations with these friends who are like minded politically.

Fair and Square Property Taxes

- Square Value: Using the square of the value
- The square value determines the portion
- But, a simplified model (it’s really just the square divided by a billion):

	- Adjustment factor = market value / 1,000,000
	- Adjusted value = market value x adjustment factor
	- Points value = Adjust value / 1000

- Tax per point is a amount due on the 14th of every month.
- Or just use an exponent.

	- With people voting on the exponent.

- Land Underutilization Tax Act

	- This tax is _in addition_ to property taxes.
	- If nearby land lots are at a higher density, your property value is adjusted to the average of the X% (e.g. 20%) of highest density lots.
	- The tax always applies, unless a waiver is granted–for example, for a park, or for a historical (e.g. church / museum / etc) building, or other highly-valuable landmark.
	- Permitted amount of green space exempt from the LUT – such green space must be made publicly accessible in order for it to be exempt from the LUT.
