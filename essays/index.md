title: My Writings
---

This is a collection of my writings. The best place to start is:

* [Who Am I?](./faith/who-am-i.md) — An intro to me, of who I am, what I live for, my life story, etc.
* [About these writings](./life/about-these-writings.md) — About the purpose, structure, organization, and nature of the writings here.

##### Topics

My writings are broadly organized under these topics:

* [Faith](./faith/_index.md): My faith informs and directs my life. I gain better understanding of my faith everyday. I document my faith journey here.

* [Life](./life/_index.md): I talk about things from my life here. I share my ups and downs, and stuff from the deep recesses of my mind. New things I'm trying. Ways in which I'm trying to change, and become a better person. Struggles I have. Etc.

* [Computer Science](./cs/_index.md): Ideas related to computer science. A lot of these might be ideas that are too hard _for me_, one person, to implement (alone). My hope in sharing these is that someone else might encounter them, and be inspired by them, and implement them themselves.

* [Technology](./tech/_index.md): General ramblings on the state of technology, as well as musings for how to use technology _in general_ to improve the world, and ideas for ways in which we could make existing technology better.

* [Politics](./pol/_index.md): A series of shorts essays documenting quest to figure out an impeccable political philosophy. Even though this is one of the most divisive and subjective topics ever, I think there exists (out there in the real of ideas), a objectively correct perfect political ideology. I am trying to figure out what it is.
