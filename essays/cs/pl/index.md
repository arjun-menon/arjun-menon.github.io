Programming language design is a topic that has been on my mind for a very long time.

\{# I've dreamed of a designing a language that would be the ideal medium of communication between a programmer and machine. #}

I've always wanted to create the "ideal" programming language -- whatever that might be. It remains a fairly amorphous concept in my head even to this day.

I've realized that I really need to think it out, in order for this to have any chance of existing.


The question of language design is one UI design.

I'm thinking of starting with researching the many languages that exist out there. Well, at least as many as is practical.


I'm thinking of having two separate languages. The first language with a high set of static guarantees, with a rich highly advanced type system, and with amazing runtime performance. The second language would be designed to be easy to use, with a lot of implicit choices and pervasive type inference that makes writing code in it very easy.


AI complicates things a bit.

Syntax, semantics, projections, etc.
