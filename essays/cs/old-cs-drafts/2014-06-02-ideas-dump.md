Computer Science Research Ideas
================================
This is paper documents my current research interests and ideas. 
Two things to keep in mind before reading this are:

- The ideas presented here are very broad and high level. I hope to eventually 
narrrow down, and focus on one area of research â€“ one that I can hopefully 
make a non-trivial contribution to.

- Many of the ideas presented here will *not* be new. They have undoubtedly 
been thought of before by other people. As such, many of these ideas could be 
classified rather as *"research interests"*.
