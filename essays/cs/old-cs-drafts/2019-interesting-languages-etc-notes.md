https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemerle
	Nemerle is a general-purpose high-level statically typed programming language designed for platforms using the Common Language Infrastructure (.NET/Mono). It offers functional, object-oriented (OO) and imperative features. It has a simple C#-like syntax and a powerful metaprogramming system.

	Interesting: "Rule 2: Give all loops a fixed upper bound. It must be trivially possible for a checking tool to prove statically that the loop cannot exceed a preset upper bound on the number of iterations. If a tool cannot prove the loop bound statically, the rule is considered violated."

	Think about designing a programming languages that enforces the 10 rules above.

	Fascinating! Thank you for sharing, OP! Having recently gone down a similar rabbit hole [1], having references and starting points is incredibly useful for further exploration, as this stuff is very hard to search for. There does seem to be a direct computational link between information and the universe - and the way we’re using this link now , with classical computers, is highly abstracted and inefficient (the article also compares current energy cost of computing vs the much much lower theoretical limit). Quantum computers come closer to the nature of that link, but still require many abstractions.

	"I wanted to learn Rust but didn't have a good project in mind. So I solved a bunch of interview problems: https://github.com/brianquinlan/learn-rust
	Solving those problems gave me a reason to touch lots of parts of the language and was also intellectually interesting."
