I write this blog humbly seeking out the purpose God has for me in this life, the meaning of life, 
the purpose of existence an

humility

candid honesty and frankness

no fear of judgement

this is not for show


"to write down what was in his heart just as it was, not obscured by any consciousness of the presence of listeners or any striving after effect"

Get off your high horse; humble yourself
