..Describe how the Holy Spirit interacts with you, and how He interacts in the lives of various other Christians. For example, Nicky Cruz's experience at the seminary in California.

Ponder how it must be to be Christian who has never had God be present in their lives in this close and intimate manner. Or those who have never experienced any sort of miracle or special event/answered prayer/gift/etc from God. How do these people keep their faith? It is truly impressive and perhaps commendable. Would you find it hard to keep your faith in such circumstances? What if you had a period of drought in your life in which you did not revive such gifts/miracles/experiences from God, and could not have the close intimacy you were used to with Him? Would you still be able to keep your faith? Would that shake you?

What is your faith in God based on? The miracles? Or His Word?
