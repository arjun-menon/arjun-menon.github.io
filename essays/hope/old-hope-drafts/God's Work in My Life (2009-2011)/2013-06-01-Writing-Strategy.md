Writing Strategy
================
	"One generation commends your works to another; they tell of your mighty acts." -- Psalm 145:4

Write whatever you recollect/remember -- in multiple files.

Let there be many files, pertaining to different reminiscinces, appropriately named.

You can only find someone (wife) through the Holy Spirit.
You want someone who is filled and lef by the Holy Spirit.

You can stich the files together, later, when you enough reminiscinces.

Friends, Relationships, the Small Group -- they are all gifts from God.
