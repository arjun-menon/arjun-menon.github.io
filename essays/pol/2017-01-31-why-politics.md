Why care about politics? I don't care about political game, but rather about results.
I am not interested in the game of politics itself, but rather am interested in getting results.
I'm not interested in the "House of Cards" game, but rather on the real-life ramifications of politics.
If a road has holes in it, it affects me. If the streets are littered with trash, it makes me unhappy.
To the extent that politics affects the lives of myself and my peers, I care about politics.
