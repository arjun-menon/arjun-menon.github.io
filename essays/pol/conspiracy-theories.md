Quote from the anime show Pantheon Episode 1 around the 20:20 mark (*slightly reworded*):
> People of all ages believe in conspiracies. Why? I think because they're scared of death. Or danger. Or chaos. Chaos is scary for a lot of people. And as weird as it sounds, they feel much better believing that there's somebody behind the scenes controlling everything. Even if that somebody is a secret society, or evil government, or even an alien force controlling the world. Now, it's still scary, but not as bad as feeling like there's no one in charge.
