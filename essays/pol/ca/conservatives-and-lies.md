“My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge” — Hosea 4:6a.

Dishonesty and misrepresentation have become a core and recurring theme of North American conservative politics and politicians. I intend to discuss that here.







There might be a place for a fiscally-conservative low-regulation/small-government point of view, but North American conservatives have long abandoned such a point of view. In Canada, the fiscally-conservative party today would be the Liberal Party of Canada. The Conservative Party of Canada has become the *"shamelessly lie to people endlessly"* party.


Areas of deception:
* People are being deceived.
* Often they repeat the same nonsense they hear.
* Canada
	* Carbon tax
        * Quotes of things the cons have said about it
        * Links to studies on it
        * The family of 4 in Alberta
        * The On Liberals’ lie on it.
    * Capital gains
        * More Lying: https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/poilievre-social-programs-1.7493270 and https://www.reddit.com/r/onguardforthee/comments/1jljhki/pierre_poilievre_denounced_the_ndps_national/ 
    * CTV: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdPiBNiedQg 
    * Lies on tariffs: https://factcheck.afp.com/doc.afp.com.36ZB6AD 
    * Pierre’s projection.
	    * journalists
	    * jusitn trudeau
	    * mark carney
    * To Pierre’s Credit:
	    * he hasn’t demonized people.
	    * he's promised to retain certain social services. (a late last-minute promise tho)
* U.S.
    * Obamacare
    * Estate tax: A More Perfect Union vid
    * Trump’s incessant lying. Over 30,000 mistruths in his first term. 
    * Pravda and Truth Social. When people loudly claim a moral value, it’s a good reason to be suspicious.
    * Copying terms like the “lugenpress”.
    * The book the spiritual dangers of drumpf.
    * Vance crying about fact checking.
    * Tariffs — the CBC video on it. Another example of a lie: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWhv-06DNjE dishonesty is their bread and butter 
    * “Even some Republicans worry privately that the proposal is deceptive.” — https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/us/politics/republicans-filibuster-tax-cuts.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare 
    * Misrepresenation regarding the us-aid cuts
    * Bruce Scheiner First Amendment destruction. The hypocrisy of speech they tolerate.
    * Worse than Nazi Germany — no warning. Thugs. Even Germany warned an American journalist and gave them time. This is horror drama, for a people who love evil and whose hearts are dark and rejoice in evil.
* Jordan Peterson’s lie about the license.
* JJ: https://archive.is/AqTSV and https://x.com/stklietsch/status/1902427679908827398

(heading 4?) Mark Carney is basically a moderate conservative. Things he’s said that sounds conservative.


(heading 4?) We have no idea what we’re getting Pierre Pollievre, since he’s a liar.


List PP’s votes on various things. The things he plans to cancel. (Except for a recent election pivot.)

Note on PP’s endless stream of lies: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=447aDYWu3FA
The economy policy of the Conservatives would hit the very people they claim to help:
* the working class people
* mid & low income people

From a Christian point of view:
* On welfare:
    * https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-49.htm “She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy”


I personally hate lying.

Disrespect for the truth is deeply disturbing to me.

Satan is the “father of lies” and “when he lies he speaks his native language”.


There’s also something about taking gleeful joy in cruelty.
    * Cons are cold-hearted, [emotionless] hateful, and without empathy. 
    * Gleeful cruelty: https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/03/gleeful-cruelty-white-house-x-account/682234/


And Insane of absurd out-of-this-world misinformation:

	* IDU among some progressives: https://www.reddit.com/r/ndp/comments/1jgfslo/nxt_conclave_it_looks_like_stephen_harper/


(heading) Question to ask: *what is the fruit of this misinformation?*

Conservatives lying about the carbon tax or capital gains hike — why it goes beyond an opinion difference. If I were a conservative, I would have used a different (more honest) approach. I imagine there are two approaches that conservatives could have used:

Approach A (more honest):
•⁠  ⁠⁠The increase in capital gains inclusion rate for people making more than $250k a year in capital gains is not good because (a) it’s not fair to tax super-wealthy more just because they are super-wealthy, (b) it could drive the super-rich people away which could actually lead to a drop in total taxes collected ( an example being Norway’s wealth tax leading to a total tax revenue drop: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/10/super-rich-abandoning-norway-at-record-rate-as-wealth-tax-rises-slightly ), and (c) real estate investors / speculators and people with second or third homes who don’t qualify for the Principle Residence Exemption would get taxed more when they sell their property, and (d) the failure to include a $250k exemption for corporations will hurt small businesses.
•⁠  ⁠Carbon tax: Even if the carbon tax financially benefits 60-80% of Canadians (as the rebate exceeds all direct and indirect costs incurred for 60-80% of people), it still quite unfair to perform a wealth transfer from 20% of Canadians to 80% of Canadians, simply on the grounds that they are polluting more. Also, the industrial carbon tax could make Canadian exports less competitive on the global market as they could cost more, and lower exports could lead to job losses in Canada.

Approach B (dishonest & misrepresentative):
•⁠  ⁠The capital gains increase will make life worse for hard-working Canadians across our country, and destroy our economy.
•⁠  ⁠⁠The carbon tax is destroying our economy, and is responsible for grocery price and other inflation.

The reason I think it constituted lying, and not merely just a difference in opinion, is because most conservatives have adopted Approach B. There are a few more-intellectual conservative think tanks that use Approach A, but almost all the conservative politicians use Approach B. Approach B is straight-up dishonest. There are a few studies that showed the total carbon tax cost for groceries (primarily the fuel charge for farmers, trucks transporting them, etc) amounted to a 0.3 % to 0.8% of grocery prices. Less than 1%. But it’s being portrayed as being 50%. Approach B about capital gains is also very dishonest, since most people going to be subject to it (as most people are not making over 250k a year, don’t own multiple homes, etc).

Approach A is difference in opinion. I agree with parts of it (e.g. small businesses need a 250k exemption like individuals). We should have balancing tariffs for countries that don’t have a carbon tax, like the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, so Canadian exports are not at a disadvantage, etc. On other points, I would disagree — but I’ll happily admit that it’s a difference of opinion.

But Approach B involves intentional dishonesty, misrepresentation, and miscommunication. Approach B (dishonesty & misrepresentation) is what’s being used by the Conservative Party of Canada almost all the time.

I’ve met people (even at church) who genuinely believe that the carbon tax is affecting them negatively — damaging their life and making it worse, and making their groceries more expensive — even though, in truth, they’re most likely getting more back in rebates. So many people falsely think the carbon tax is bad and hurting them basically as the result of an insanely-dishonest misinformation campaign.

Based on various Bible verses, dishonesty & misrepresentation make me very uncomfortable. Especially when someone is willing to just persistently lie non-stop. When there’s so much compulsive incessant lying, it reminds me of John 8:44 in which Jesus says this about the devil: “When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.” I personally think it’s spiritually dangerous of emulate / copy a behavioral trait of Satan.

The issue of discernment of the truth—vaccines, science, climate change, carbon tax, etc.
