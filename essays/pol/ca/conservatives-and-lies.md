title: Conservative Politicians and Lies – a Culture of Deception
desc: Dishonesty and Misrepresentation are the bread and butter of North American conservative politicians. The extreme, rampant, and pervasive dishonesty of conservative politicians is evil.
public: true
---

Unfortunately, dishonesty and misrepresentation have become a core and recurring theme of North American conservative politics and politicians. I will discuss this sad state of affairs in both Canada and the U.S., by touching on a few demonstrative examples.

Lying is not a good thing. Lying deceives people. Lying breaks trust. God hates lying.

While all politicians (all _all people_ in general) might lie to a certain extent, the pestilence of lying has become particularly extreme, thematic, and all-too-common, among ***conservative politicians***. Moreover, the manner in which conservative politicians use their speech – the persistent compulsive lying, the abusive language and invective, and an utter disregard for truthfulness – has had a corrupting influence on political culture in North America.

### People are being deceived

A lot of people in North America have unfortunately believed the incessant stream of dishonest statements conservative politicians make, and become fooled by it, and thus have been deceived into lending these conservative politicians their support.

Many people often repeat the same nonsense they hear.

Many people blindly trust these lying politicians; not having recognized the lies for what they are.

> Hitler had what one might call a diffident, occasionally felonious disregard for financial matters. He owed 400,000 reichsmarks in back taxes. His understanding of economics was primitive. “You have inflation only if you want it,” Hitler once said. “Inflation is a lack of discipline. I will see to it that prices remain stable. I have my S.A. for that.” (The S.A., or Brownshirts, were the original paramilitary organization associated with the Nazi Party.) Hitler held Jews responsible for most of Germany’s financial woes.

Conservatives lying about the carbon tax or capital gains hike — why it goes beyond an opinion difference. If I were a conservative, I would have used a different (more honest) approach. I imagine there are two approaches that conservatives could have used:

Approach A (more honest):
* The increase in capital gains inclusion rate for people making more than $250k a year in capital gains is not good because (a) it’s not fair to tax super-wealthy more just because they are super-wealthy, (b) it could drive the super-rich people away which could actually lead to a drop in total taxes collected ( an example being Norway’s wealth tax leading to a total tax revenue drop: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/10/super-rich-abandoning-norway-at-record-rate-as-wealth-tax-rises-slightly ), and (c) real estate investors / speculators and people with second or third homes who don’t qualify for the Principle Residence Exemption would get taxed more when they sell their property, and (d) the failure to include a $250k exemption for corporations will hurt small businesses.
* Carbon tax: Even if the carbon tax financially benefits 60-80% of Canadians (as the rebate exceeds all direct and indirect costs incurred for 60-80% of people), it still quite unfair to perform a wealth transfer from 20% of Canadians to 80% of Canadians, simply on the grounds that they are polluting more. Also, the industrial carbon tax could make Canadian exports less competitive on the global market as they could cost more, and lower exports could lead to job losses in Canada.

Approach B (dishonest & misrepresentative):
* The capital gains increase will make life worse for hard-working Canadians across our country, and destroy our economy.
* The carbon tax is destroying our economy, and is responsible for grocery price and other inflation.

The reason I think it constituted lying, and not merely just a difference in opinion, is because most conservatives have adopted Approach B. There are a few more-intellectual conservative think tanks that use Approach A, but almost all the conservative politicians use Approach B. Approach B is straight-up dishonest. There are a few studies that showed the total carbon tax cost for groceries (primarily the fuel charge for farmers, trucks transporting them, etc) amounted to a 0.3 % to 0.8% of grocery prices. Less than 1%. But it’s being portrayed as being 50%. Approach B about capital gains is also very dishonest, since most people going to be subject to it (as most people are not making over 250k a year, don’t own multiple homes, etc).

Approach A is difference in opinion. I agree with parts of it (e.g. small businesses need a 250k exemption like individuals). We should have balancing tariffs for countries that don’t have a carbon tax, like the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, so Canadian exports are not at a disadvantage, etc. On other points, I would disagree — but I’ll happily admit that it’s a difference of opinion.

But Approach B involves intentional dishonesty, misrepresentation, and miscommunication. Approach B (dishonesty & misrepresentation) is what’s being used by the Conservative Party of Canada almost all the time.

I’ve met people (even at church) who genuinely believe that the carbon tax is affecting them negatively — damaging their life and making it worse, and making their groceries more expensive — even though, in truth, they’re most likely getting more back in rebates. So many people falsely think the carbon tax is bad and hurting them basically as the result of an insanely-dishonest misinformation campaign.

Based on various Bible verses, dishonesty & misrepresentation make me very uncomfortable. Especially when someone is willing to just persistently lie non-stop. When there’s so much compulsive incessant lying, it reminds me of John 8:44 in which Jesus says this about the devil: “When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.” I personally think it’s spiritually dangerous of emulate / copy a behavioral trait of Satan.

The issue of discernment of the truth—vaccines, science, climate change, carbon tax, etc.

There might be a place for a fiscally-conservative low-regulation/small-government point of view, but North American conservatives have long abandoned such a point of view. In Canada, the fiscally-conservative party today would be the Liberal Party of Canada. The Conservative Party of Canada has become the *"shamelessly lie to people endlessly"* party.

My own 2 lies in the past month: I remember distincitly that I felt really dirty about it, and how it’s not okay at all - no matter who is doing it. And I’m working on getting better at this — and not lying at all ever; if anything, I can simply refuse to answer a question when asked, instead of making dishonest statements.

The conservatives feel so comfortable with lying / general dishonesty, that they have no problem pretending like all the people sent to CECOT were criminals, whereas in reality circa 75% of deportees to CECTO had no criminal recrod. This comfort of theirs with lying is disgusting. Everyone in that room knew full well that they were lying, but they felt perfectly comfortable with lying. In general, due process — a disrespect for the principles of Magna Carta and the Bill of Rights has been a conservative attitude for a long time.

[…] I don’t know if these people are just stupid or what. I think you have the lying conservative politicians on the top who just blatantly plain evil, and then you have large masses of low intelligence people who believe all the lies have little understanding of constitutional rights and freedoms, and just go carry on with the evil and wickedness of hatred of the other outgroup.

These people are behaving worse than the Nazis were in the mid-1930s with a foreign journalist they didn’t like.
