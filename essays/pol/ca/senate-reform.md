The Senate could become the proportional representation body of the country.


STV-PR


Weighted votes


The House could override the Senate either with:
* With a four-sevenths majority of all members (not just those present) of the House.  A required 3-month delay for this?
* Calling a national referendum that is completed while the current House has not been dissolved yet.
