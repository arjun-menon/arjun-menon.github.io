    Chapter 10

    Page 69:

    The preacher just stood there, smiling, with his hand stuck out. I always prided myself on not being afraid. But I was afraid. Deeply afraid that this man was going to put me in a cage. He was going to take away my friends. He was going to upset everything and because of this I hated him.

    Page 71:

    I tried to stare him down, but he kept talking. "Nicky, I'm not scared of you. You talk tough but inside you're just like all the rest of us. You're afraid. You're sick of your sin. You're lonely. But Jesus loves you."

    Something clicked. How did he know that I was lonely? I didn't know what he was talking about when he said sin. I was afraid to admit my fear. But how did he know I was lonely? The gang was always with me. I had any of the girls I wanted. People were afraid of meâ€”they would see me coming and move off the sidewalk and into the street. I had been the leader of the gang. How could anyone think I was lonely. And yet I was. And now this preacher knew it.

    "Nicky, you didn't sleep much last night, did you?" Again, I was amazed. How did he know that I hadn't slept? Wilkerson continued, "I didn't sleep much last night either, Nicky. I stayed awake most of the night praying for you. But before I did, I talked to some of your boys. They tell me that no one can get close to you. They are all afraid of you. But Nicky, I've come to tell you that somebody does care. Jesus cares. He loves you." And then he looked me straight in the face, 

        "One day, soon, Nicky, God's Spirit is going to deal with you. One day, Nicky, you are going to stop running and come running to Him."
