How do I keep myself happy and positive when there are so many free variables ahead of me?

I know I have to keep myself positive and happy when my future is uncertain – when I don't know 
what's next in my life; when there are so mnay uncertainities ahead, that I *don't feel in 
control*. What do I do in these circumstances? 

How I keep my cool, and moreover – be joyful, happy, and positive in every way?!?

A positive, joyful, happy mind is necessary for many reasons. Here's just a few of them: 
(1) It's difficult to be a good friend, to pour into the lives of others positively, when 
you yourself are pulled down by all these types of "dark" emotions, and are *yourself* 
in need of help. To be a good friend, you've got to be someone that your close friends 
can lean on, in their times of troubles. In turn, you can lean on them as well, in your 
difficult times. But do you want to be that friend who is always in need of suppport? 
Don't you want to be that person from whom good feelings emanate – the person who makes 
a party (I mean a group of people here) happy and full of joy? 

(2) Another good reason to *always* keep your spirits up is that it's hard to live to 
your full potential when you're down. Duh, that's obvious, you might be saying. Yes, but 
a reminder is always good! :-) In particular, it's *difficult to be creative* when you're 
pulled down by all sorts of dark, nasty emotions. High spirits are, at least to my knowledge, 
a key ingredient in a creative mind – one bubbling with cool/useful news ideas and thoughts! 
And creativity, be it in any form, is something I truly love. I love writing; thinking up 
new ideas and thoughts, and writing about them. I love thinking about hard problems in 
Computer Science, ruminating about deeply, and when I understand something, or realize 
a way in which something could be done better – it feels oh-so-awesome! Keepin' the 
creative juices flowing, and giving my mind things to think about, at least to me is 
a *big part of a **good life.*** :-)




A mind that is burdened down with fear, anxiety, and doubt does not do well.

How do I do it? How do I snub out those stubborn feelings of anxiety, duobt, and fear? 





through hope

keeping positive outlook, hoping *and* believing that good things will happen

you've got to let go of that negativity
negativity will lead autmatically to bad things happening
that negativity will prevent good thigns from happening
do you've got to snub out that negativity

you also have to realize that you're negativity is not well-warranted
it's not rational or backed by solid reason
recognize the inherent distorted thinking behind your negative emotions, 
and show to yourself (to your own mind) tht they're irrational!
