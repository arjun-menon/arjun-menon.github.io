"That is probably more of a book report than is needed but that's about it. The one thing I will say is that the money, while very good and nice to have, wasn't the end all be all that I thought it would be. I figured I'd easily meet the right woman with all the money I have, but I haven't, in fact the women I have mentioned it to on dates didn't even care (or believe me, or both). I don't really get treated any differently either, other than by the developers who know that I know what I'm doing. I also realized that I don't care about material things all that much. The most fun I get is out of achieving new things, rather than things the money can buy."

"At my graduation, we had a tremendous speaker. The biggest take away from her speech was (I think she said she got it from a book), life is about juggling balls. Your career ball is like a rubber ball and if you drop it, it will bounce back. The other balls are made out of glass, and it shatters when you drop it. You may be able to rebuild the ball, but it'll never be the same.

That really made me re-think about my focuses. Since I am a recent graduate, I thought being successful was everything, but I was sitting there hearing someone who was successful and very influential in the industry telling me that it's not all that. Balance your life, and make time for the people in your life. When you think back one day, you won't remember that week where you worked that extra 10 hours, you'll remember the time you had with the people you made time for."
