Recently, a close friend of mine, Michael Butindaro, passed away.

Reflecting on it, I have been reminded of the ephemeral nature of the time 
that God given us, on this Earth. Like the "lilies and the flower on the 
field" we shall soon pass away, and we are "nothing but a mere breath, 
a vapor" on the grand scale of time. But of course, we do matter -- none of 
this diminishes the value of a human soul, which is eternal. It just puts into 
perspective the short time that God has given us people on this Earth.
