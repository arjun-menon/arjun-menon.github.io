title: Reminding Myself to Seek God
---

the beauty beyond 


the wonderfulness of his wisdom
    the pslams, proverbs


medidating on the pslams in wonderful


being awestruck with the plans he has for the world
    to redeem the world
    to put an end to cruelty and injustice
    that there is going to be justice in the end after all

    the beautiful and wonderous future he has for us


the Bible (and promises therein) are too wonderful to 
have been a product of human imagination
