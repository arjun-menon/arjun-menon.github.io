title: An Observation On Identities

people have different kinds of identities, potentially multiple

ex: Christ, Music, Developer/CS/etc, LGBT, national (American, Indian), etc.
    a group/professional identity usually eclpises one's national identity, etc

some identites are bigger than others, 
    and when people have multiple identities, 
    they sometimes compete with each other
