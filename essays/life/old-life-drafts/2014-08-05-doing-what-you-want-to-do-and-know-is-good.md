Why do some people do things that they don't want to do




self-esteem, self-confidence, etc





what bout forcing myself to do thing that I believe are good for me, but 
might not be what's best for me?
    when these are personal proejects, would it be better if i rather did the 
    things that i felt more of a passion and interest for doing, rather those "good" things?
