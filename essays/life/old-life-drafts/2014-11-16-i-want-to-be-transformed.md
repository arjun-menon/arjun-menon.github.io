title: I want To Be Transformed
---

For too long I have been spiritually dead. I have been distant from the Lord. 

I have been like a dead man walking -- without radiant fullness of life that Christ promises.
I wish this to change. I wish to be filled with his life so that I myself may live fully and truly.


My Plan of Action
------------------

I intend to seek you everyday, **diligently, in prayer**.

I intend to **mediate on your Word, everday**.


I intend to absorb every bit of it, and embed your words deep inside my soul.



Lord, help me do this. 
Motivate me, and remind me of the good things that will come out of this.



My Prayer to the Lord
----------------------

Lord I have a prayer today. 
I pray that I would be transformed in your image. 
Lord, I pray that I would become a different person. 
Not the person I am today, but someone different. 
Someone whose spirit is deeply entwined with yours, with the Holy Spirit's. 

Lord change my heart. 
I no longer want to be the person I am today. 
Lord, please fill me up with Holy Spirit.
Change me from the inside out. 
Cleanse my heart, and purify my soul.

Teach me your ways, O Lord

Lord, I take practical steps today towards this goal. Please help me.

I


I want to get to know the Lord, deeply and personally.
I want to be able to speak to Him through the Holy Spirit at any time.
I want to the gift of hearing from the Holy Spirit whenever He speaks to me.

I want my current life to pass away, and a new life to come into existence.
A new me -- renewed and rejuvenated my pouring in of the Holy Spirit into my life.
