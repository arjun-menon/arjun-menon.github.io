avoiding people's questions almost instantly, subconsciously 
the pretension of not understanding questions

nned to move away from this

in terms of change; it is hard for to me follow (or obey) a negative rule 
or order (i.e. "don't X", "don't covet"), and it is a lot easier for me to follow a 
positive idea/statement (like "be content with what you have", "love your neighbor"), etc.
i feel negative rules, sometimes, leaves a vacuum behind, waiting to be filled

keeping that in mind, a goal I set up for myself is:
like Jesus, to answer the true intent and the *true* question behind the spoken question
