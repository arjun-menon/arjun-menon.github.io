title = "About These Writings"
+++

I write here on a variety of topics. On topics that interest me, and in areas where I feel have something to add, or something valuable to share.

##### Why write?

Life is a journey, of sorts. And I want to share this journey with others, here. I want to share, what I’m learning, thoughts and ideas I have, the experiences I have in life, in this place. I want this to be a place of frank and honest straightforward reflection. A place for a search for meaning. A place for a search for ways to somehow improve or perfect the planet we find ourselves on.

	People spend their entire lives learning how to write effectively. It isn't something you can fake. It isn't something you can buy. You have to work at it.

	That's exactly why people who are afraid they can't write should be blogging.

	It's exercise. No matter how out of shape you are, if you exercise a few times a week, you're bound to get fitter. Write a small blog entry a few times every week and you're bound to become a better writer. If you're not writing because you're intimidated by writing, well, you're likely to stay that way forever.

	Why a Digital Diary Will Change Your Life

		I found something so rare it feels sacred — a digital space that values private, quiet contemplation.

##### Dynamicity

The stuff I've written here will remain in flux. This is not a chronological blog where old posts remain unchanged, but a repository of ideas and thoughts. The writings here could change over time. I could revisit old pieces and refine and reword them. I might combine multiple essays into a single one, or split a single essay into multiple essays, and expand upon them. In general, nothing is static in here.

### Self-imposed Limit

I'm going to live by the advice in Ephesians 4:29 in terms of what I put out here.
I'm only going to write things that will edify and help the reader in some way.
Also James 3.
