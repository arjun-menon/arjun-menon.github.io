I'd like to share a realization that came to me today.

Sometimes, when I kneel down to pray, or when I lay my bible in front of me for 
a period of intense/dedicated study -- there are many nagging wordly conecerns 
tugging at my mind, trying to or succeeding in taking my focus away that which 
is at hand (the prayer, the bible study, or some other form of seeking Him).

Today, I realized how destructive and dangerous this could be to one's genuine, 
sincere seeking of Christ. I feel that, when we kneel down (or sit or stand or 
whatever) to pray to God, we should *ideally* not have other things on our mind. 
Now I know that it is not possible for us human beings to be perfect in our 
mental devotions. Moreover, trying to "concentrate" can actually detract from a 
genuine sincere prayer.

I think what we need to do, and try to do -- is leave *all other things behind*, 
when we go to the Lord. Leave that conversation you had with your friend behind; 
leave anything from work on your mind behind; leave any other thing that doesn't 
belong on the Lord's table behind. If there is something *you cannot leave behind*, 
then it probably is something that *needs to be bought to the Lord*. So then 
bring it forth to the Lord, in **prayer** and **petition**.


What ideally needs to happen is that we are wholly and willingly caught up in 
our worship of the Lord, and the 

 these impediments
