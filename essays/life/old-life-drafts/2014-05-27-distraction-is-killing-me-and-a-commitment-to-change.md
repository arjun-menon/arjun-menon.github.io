Obeying God hsas beocme very difficult for me,... because my mind is not in my 
control. It is always raging with thoughts, ideas -- uncontained and controlled. 

I need to quite my soul -- rest my sould, my inmost self -- only then will I 
have peace.

I pray God that He would quite my soul, and rest my mind -- and bring stillness 
to it -- so that _I may hear **His** voice_. Amen.
