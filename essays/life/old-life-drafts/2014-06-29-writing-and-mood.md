writing as a brain dump



I have a problem. Sometimes, I get inspired to write a certain post, and I quickly jot down the 
core ideas that will form the meat of the post (or sometimes just one or two sentences describing 
what I want to write about).[1] My hope in doing so is that when I get back to this little note 
later that some of that old inspiration will flow back into me, and I'll be infused with a mental 
energy and excitement for writing it.

But I often find myself in the prenicious situation of not having the "old inspiration" and 
excitement come back. And writing the post, then, sometimes feels like drudge work. I think part 
of the reason may be that I'm missing some of the context behind the "old inspiration" (I just 
came to realize this recently). I've decided to, at times, note down what led to the "idea" or 
what inspired to write about X. But regardless of all of that, the problem of inspiration and 
motivation in relation to writing, still stands.


I have to *really put myself there*

allow myself and my mind to be absorbed by that topic, once more


i have realized that I have transplant myself back there
i have to condition my mind to once more be _in that place_, in order to get those mental juices 
running.

if there's time though, try writing as much as possible, along with the core ideas, in the time 
available to you at that moment.


[1] I have to credit Roald Dahl for this. I think it was in his book *Boy*, a well-written and 
arresting autobiography, that I first came across this idea. Roald 
Dahl mentions how when he first got the idea for Charlie and Glass Elevator, he immediately 
scribbled something to remind him of that idea on his car. He emphasizes the importance of 
noting down ideas, as they go as quickly as they come.
