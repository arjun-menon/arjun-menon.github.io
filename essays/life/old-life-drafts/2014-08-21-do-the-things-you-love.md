Do meaninful, fulfilling work instead of spending time in a stupor reading blogs, etc.

- delve in detail into this

- explaing the stupor that random surfing, tv shows, games, etc puts you in
    - it's okay to be in the stupor state once in a while, as a break, but don't overindulge

- don't waste your time and your life doing these things that you'll regret later

- instead work on the stuff you'll later be happy you did

- static friction
    - once you start doing X, you'll be in the thick of it,
