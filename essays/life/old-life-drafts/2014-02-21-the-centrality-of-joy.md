The Centrality of Joy
=====================

I came up on a realization recently: *the centrality of **joy**.* 
In the past, I've had an inkling of the cruciality of joy, but 
until quite recently I did not realize the *overriding importance* of it.

I came across 3 key realizations:

1. We are supposed to *actively pursue* joy.




How does being a Christian relate to joy?

### Personal Joy

I think we are supposed to actively *pursue* joy.

### Being Light

Not only are we called to be joyful ourselves, but we are called to make others around us joyful.

Persona Joy is perhaps a preqreuisite to infecting other people with joy
        but probably CS Lewis' "mask" idea works here -- ie. when we try to spread joy, we 
        become joyful ourselves


### Heaven's Promise

I think one of the big promises of heaven will be *joy*.

Not only shall every tear be wiped away, but there shall be great rejoicing 



#### Christ Suffered for joy

"For the joy that was set before him "



The Greek word used here for joy is **xyz** 


### One of the purposes of creation

I think joy 





### Life as a Christian

> Rejoice in the Lord Always

This is a critical commandment 

when battling dark forces

Satan tries to pull us down with ***fear*** and hopelessness that lead to 
depression, and snuffs out our joy

Rejoicing is a tool and weapon in the ongoing spiritual warfare.

It is reflection of our future resurrected state (in Heaven), and when 
we rejoice in the deep spiritual manner that God calls us to, a piece of 
Heaven becomes manifest on Earth.


## Biblical "Rejoice" Commandments

There are **216** occurences of the word "_rejoice_" in the HCSB English 
translation of the Bible.

Here are a list of some of those commandments, and their contexts:


Here is a list of them:

### TWO LISTS

There are two lists that you should _always_ keep handy:
	* Reasons to Rejoice (your own personalized list of reason to)
    * List of Things You Are **Thankful** For

These two powerful lists will keep every form of sadness, depression, 
melancholy at bay, and help you be powerful in every walk of life, 
and enable you to fully manifest the gifts Christ has *given you*.

	The Striking Parallel

	Which brings us, finally, to Jesus. In Hebrews 12, Jesus is contrasted with Esau. Esau could not endure missing one meal for the joy of his inheritance (Hebrews 12:16). But Jesus “endured the cross for the joy set before him” (Hebrews 12:2). It is a striking parallel in the original Greek, evident in our English:

	Esau
	who for a single meal
	sold his birthright. (Hebrews 12:16)

	Jesus
	who for the joy set before him
	endured the cross. (Hebrews 12:2)
