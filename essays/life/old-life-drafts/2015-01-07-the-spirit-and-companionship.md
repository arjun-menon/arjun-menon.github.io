Comments to take notice of:

"I thought the most profound thing mentioned in this article was that loneliness was about intimacy. Not necessarily physical intimacy, but social intimacy. This is exceedingly important subtlety. Too often we say things like "go be social, go hang out." You can "be social", but non-intimate relationships (relationships with people you don't trust, people who are cruel, people who aren't authentic) do not have good therapeutic value." -- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5701217

"... I gradually withdrew from my friends, trying to stick more to non-party/bar settings so we could have what I considered to be more real, deeper conversations; but I had changed, and they had not. It was very isolating. I gradually discovered that a few of these friends also were craving deeper interaction (cue jokes, okay, okay) and those friends became not only the people I hung out with more, but the ones whose friendships with me lasted decades until today. But there was a seriously lonely stretch until I discovered that, and it was all about social intimacy -- not physical, not being among people, but sharing our true selves in conversation and companionship." -- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5700562

Think about what's highlighted in bold, above, and think about what the Spirit revealed to you, between Fall 2009 to Fall 2010.  It was powerful, it was real.  You know it.  Remember.


Write about this. Write about how the Spirit brought you to this realization.  How it profoundly affected your life;  how it made you work on your relationships more;  and how it eventually led you down a road that would lead you into the true life -- life with God -- life as it was meant to be, for all humans; the original plan -- where true companionship, eternal companionship, of an unbreakable nature and of infinitely more depth than the closest of human friends could experience (the only human beside Jesus to have experienced it is perhaps the guy in Genesis who didn't die, but rather was taken up into Heave, who walked with God on Earth).  How this -- the bond between humans - the bond between souls; is more crucial than anything else in this world -- more relevant to a human life than anything ---- that it is where true happiness comes from.  True happiness is found in this, not anything else.


Thank you Lord Jesus, for rescuing me and having mercy on me (a sinner).
