Romans 6:12

"Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires."


In context:
-----------

In the same way, count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Jesus Christ.
Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires.

Do not offer the parts of your body to sin, as instruments of wickedness, but rather 
offer yourselves to God, as those who have been brought from death to life; and 
offer the part of your body to him as instruments of righteousness.

***For sin shall not be your master, because you are not under law, but under grace.***
