Focus, To-do List Anxiety, and Work



the book you've been reading (provide kindle/amazon link), 
    what you hope to get out of it




I've realized that I'm nearly addicted to being "out of it" â€“ i.e. not focusing on anything. 
I, for some strange reason, don't like getting into ***the flow***. (The flow is a state in 
which your mind is intently focused on one things, and one in which you're very productive.*) 
Hmm, why do I not like getting into flow? Once I'm in it, I'm in it, and there's no pressing 
desire or need to get out of it. But the trouble is *getting in*.
