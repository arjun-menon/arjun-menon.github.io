Welcome to my little corner on the internet. I'm Arjun Menon. I'm a software engineer who enjoys programming, reading (and learning new things), writing, and good conversation. Some of my favorite topics include computer science / software, religion, politics, history, etc.

I write here, and on medium. A few of my writings, organized by topic, are:{# Some of my pieces include: #}

### Software

I'm looking for new job opportunities at the moment. Feel free to take a look at my open source works [on GitHub](https://github.com/arjun-menon), or my [résumé](https://gratom.com/arjun-menon/resume/), or the recommendations I've received on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arjungmenon/). If you know of any jobs that I might be a good fit for, please send them my way!

* Some of my recently-updated open source software includes:
	* [Alteza](https://github.com/arjun-menon/alteza): a static site generator (used by this site).
	* [PyPage](https://github.com/arjun-menon/pypage): a template language & engine (also used by this site).
	* [Tax Analyzer](https://github.com/arjun-menon/tax-analyzer): a tax breakdown tool. [Check it out here](https://arjun-menon.com/tax-analyzer).
	* [CashTrack](https://github.com/gratom-inc/CashTrack)<sup>(wip)</sup>: a work-in-progress cash flow tracking tool.

* Some of my older open source software includes:
	* [NeoLisp](https://github.com/novarc/NeoLisp): an experimental LISP dialect.
	* [Distributed graph algorithms](https://github.com/arjun-menon/Distributed-Graph-Algorithms): implementations of a few distributed graph algorithms, where each node in the graph is a process, and IPC is used to solve graph problems.
	* [Multi Adblock Detect](https://github.com/arjun-menon/multi-adblock-detect) ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multi-adblock-detect)): a library containing a React hook for detecting ad blockers.

I hope to write more stuff in the near future, and publish it here as well as elsewhere.
