I've found spoken or written prayer to be more effective _(at making me feel better)_.
Even if the speaking was done whispering.
Even if the writing was rambly.

It might be just be who I am -- it might be that I find it easier to control the flow
of my thoughts and my mind when I'm praying while speaking quitely, or writing.

That is not to lower the value and impact of silent prayer (c.f. 1 Samuel 1:10-19).

That's why I said "_maaking me feel better_", since I'm just looking at it from
that perspective from now. God hears us no matter how we pray. I just feel it's
been a bit more effective for me _personally_.
