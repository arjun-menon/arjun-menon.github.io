desc: A series of fictional short stories.

This is a place for my fiction writings. I'm hoping the fiction I write will be meaningful in some (deeper) way, or entertaining at the very least.

My first and only story (with a _not-so-creative_ temporary placeholder name), which is an _ongoing_ work is:

* [**Endor: _On Truth & Lies_**]({{link('endor')}})
