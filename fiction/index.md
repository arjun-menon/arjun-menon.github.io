desc: A series of fictional short stories.

This is a place for my fiction writings. I'm hoping the fiction I write will be meaningful in some (deeper) way, or entertaining at the very least.

I'm starting with writing a series of short stories, partly inspired by the universes of Tolkien, C.S. Lewis' [Space Triology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Space_Trilogy)<sup>([fandom](https://the-silent-planet.fandom.com/wiki/Ransom_trilogy), [narniafans](https://narniafans.com/books/the-space-trilogy/))</sup>, [Frieren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frieren), Harry Potter, etc.

The first of the series, with a _not-so-creative_ temporary placeholder name, is [Endor]({{link('endor')}}) <sup><small>([definition](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Endor))</small></sup>.
